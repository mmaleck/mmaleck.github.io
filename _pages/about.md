Mary M. (Molly) Maleckar
-----
I am currently working as a Research Professor at Simula Research, Inc. I have recently been in the role of Director of Modeling at the Allen Institute for Cell Science, also working with an enthusiastic interdisciplinary team committed to high impact and open science. 

My earlier positions at Simula Research Laboratory in the Computational Cardiac Modeling division included full-time focus on research as a principal investigator as well several years in research management and administration with part-time research activity.

As the former leader of my research department and former Director of the Simula School of Research and Education, I try to bring both an interdisciplinary and global perspective to my work. This means being open to concepts from both related and unrelated fields of research to support and guide translational science. Simply stated, I enjoy work which occurs at the intersection of technology and biology - I am fascinated by our growing ability to understand previously enigmatic aspects of the human body via advances in the technological world.

I have also worked as an academic tutor and educator at the high school and university levels for almost two decades. The experience of educating others is an edifying one that has honed my teaching skills, as well as my ability to communicate a variety of scientific and technological concepts to a diverse audience.
